        iTraveller aggregates native wholesale suppliers who are responsible for the services, thereby panning
        out a scalable market place model, for the first time in India for holidays. The travellers who
        come online on iTraveller can choose their destinations, discover the hotels and transfers,
        compare reviews and plan their activities and sightseeing for their trips. By virtue of having the
        native wholesale suppliers who own the inventory and best prices on the platform, the travellers also
        get to discover the best available prices from the market. There are over 2 Lakhs trips created by users
        on iTraveller, features over 20 travel destinations across the globe and over 60 native wholesale suppliers
